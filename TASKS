players have:
 - "clicks" which are actions they can take
   + start with 6 clicks
   + clicks regenrate at a rate of 1-per-8 hours
   + clicks can:
     * invite a new player
     * build a connection with an existing player
     * strengthen a connected node (by how much?)
 - life force
   + goes from 0 (dead) to 100 (totally healthy)
   + can't below 0 or above 100
   + strengthening a connected node gives it 25 health (and 10 for you)
   + at 0 life force a player is dead (and doesn't get clicks)
   + dead players can be revived if another player strengthens them
 - connections
   + are created by clicks
   + may be randomly destroyed
   + do not have health or energy
   + are needed to be able to use clicks to strenghten players

destroyer:
 - randomly chooses edges to delete
 - also weakens all nodes based on the "rate of decay"
 - rate of decay is % of life force to be lost when the destroy runs
 - e.g. 1% decay means every time it runs, players lose 1 life.
        5% decay means every time it runs, players lose 5 life.
 - destroy runs about once-per-hour of browser time (i.e. per player)

 - possible decay formula:
        t = minutes since last action
        f(t) = round(log(t + 1)), as a percentage

 - i.e. f(1 minute) = 1%
        f(30 minutes) = 3%
        f(24 hours) = 7%
        f(1 week) = 9%
        f(1 year) = 13%
 - when destroyer runs, 20% chance of destroying a random connection
