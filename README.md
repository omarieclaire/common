# common

Common is a play experience for communities. 

Common begins with a single player, a node floating around on a website (commonplay.ca). They exist in a vast nothingness. The first thing they notice is that their life-force is decreasing, they are slowly eroding into the nothingness.

There is an enemy, the “unmaker”; a force that deteriorates the life-force of players and the life-force of the connections between them. 

The only way to fight against this erosion is by inviting people to join Common: building connections with new players. Players are sources of energy, and strong connections allow life-energy to regenerate and flow. 


## Getting Started

```shell
npm install firebase-tools
./node_modules/.bin/firebase login
```

## Developing

Run

```shell
./node_modules/.bin/firebase serve --project common-d2ecf
```

This will allow you to access common at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You need to work this way so we can access `firebase` and allow it to vendor credentials.
